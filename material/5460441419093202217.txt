numbers?

Force
Newton’s Laws
Newton’s Second Law

Enduring Understanding - A net force is required to change an object's velocity; no force is required
to explain constant velocity.

Learning Targets: 7, 8, 10, 11

Recall
An UNBALANCED force is required to change an object’s motion. An UNBALANCED Force is also called the
NET force and is equal to the sum of all forces, ΣF.
UNBALANCED Force = NET Force = ΣF (sum of forces)
Σ is the capital Greek letter sigma and means to sum or add up. In the case of ΣF it means to add up all the
forces acting on an object.
1. Describe the motion of an object experiencing an UNBALANCED force.

Newton’s Second Law of Motion
The acceleration of an object is proportional to the net force applied to the object and inversely proportional
to the object’s mass.
2.

3.

Express Newton’s Second Law as a mathematical proportion.
acceleration is proportional (α) to the
net force applied to the object

acceleration is inversely proportional
to the object’s mass

a α _____

a α _____

Express Newton’s Second Law as a mathematical equation.

How do we know if we have an unbalanced force and if so in what direction is it acting? The solution to this
problem is the construction of Free-Body Diagrams or FBDs.
Free-Body Diagram Construction
A free body diagram (FBD) is a vector drawing of all OUTSIDE (external) forces acting on an object.
Guidelines for drawing FBD’s
● Forces are vectors and must include magnitude and direction.
● Force vectors are drawn from the center of the object and always point away from the object to indicate
the effect the force has on the object.
● Each vector must be labeled with the type of force it represents.
For the following scenarios, use the following:
W or Fg = Force of Gravity

FThrust = FT = force of thrust

FLift = FL = force of lift

Fdrag = Fd = Frictional force that opposes motion,
air resistance

Horizontal and Vertical Forces
